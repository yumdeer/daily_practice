    To receive broadcast isochronous streams, the Link Layer must obtain the
    BIGInfo describing the streams (see Section 4.4.6.11). This information may be
    obtained from the ACAD of periodic advertising.
    While in this state, the Link Layer shall listen on the isochronous channel
    indices specified in Section 4.4.6.8 for BIS Data PDUs forming the BIG
    specified in the BIGInfo. In the synchronizing sub-state, if the Link Layer does
    not receive a BIS Data PDU within 6 BIG events, starting with the first BIG
    event it listened for, it shall notify the Host and transition to the Standby state.
    Once in the synchronized sub-state, the Link Layer shall listen for the
    Isochronous Broadcaster at least once within any 6 consecutive BIS events.
    A device shall not attempt to synchronize to a BIG with the same associated
    periodic advertising train as a BIG that it is already synchronized to.
    A device that has synchronized to a BIG is called a Synchronized Receiver. A
    Synchronized Receiver may, but it is not required to, remain synchronized to
    the periodic advertising train.
    If requested by the Host, the Link Layer shall report the isochronous data
    received in the BIS Data PDUs forming the BIG to the Host. The Host may
    specify that only the data from specific BISes within the BIG are reported. The
    Link Layer shall listen to and act on the contents of new BIG Control PDUs.
    The Link Layer need not listen to Broadcast Isochronous PDUs that are
    retransmissions of PDUs already successfully received, or to BIS Data PDUs
    where it will not be reporting the data to the Host, other than as necessary to
    maintain synchronization with the Isochronous Broadcaster’s clock.
    The Link Layer should perform the window widening specified in Section 4.2.4.
    The Link Layer shall stop listening to the BIG no later than when the
    bisPayloadCounter equals 239 – 1.
